How to Use This Chrome Extension
This extension will allow you to extract events from your intranet page and either:

Export them as an ICS file (which can be imported into Google Calendar)
Directly sync them with your Google Calendar

Setup Instructions:

Create a new directory for your extension
Create these files in the directory:

manifest.json
content.js
popup.html
popup.js
background.js


Create an images directory and add icon images (16px, 48px, and 128px)
Set up Google OAuth:

Go to the Google Cloud Console
Create a new project
Enable the Google Calendar API
Create OAuth credentials for a Chrome extension
Update the manifest.json file with your client ID


Load the extension in Chrome:

Go to chrome://extensions/
Enable "Developer mode"
Click "Load unpacked" and select your extension directory



How It Works:

The extension finds all elements on the page with "event_registered" class (registered events)
It extracts relevant information like course name, time, room, etc.
It lets you export this data as an ICS file or sync directly with Google Calendar

Customization Tips:

Update the host permissions in manifest.json to match your actual intranet domain
Modify the event extraction logic in content.js if your HTML structure differs
Add date detection to handle proper calendar dates (currently uses current date as placeholder)
